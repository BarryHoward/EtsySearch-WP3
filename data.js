Requests for proofs will be disregarded unless you have paid for custom designed artwork.

If we do make a mistake on the engraving and do not engrave as you instruct, we will correct it immediately and free of charge!\n\nVINYL DECALS\nOur vinyl decals are cut from industrial sign grade vinyl that is rated for 6 years of full weather outdoor use, and lifetime interior use. The vinyl decals look fantastic, providing a stencil painted look on your wall without the mess.\n\nBecause vinyl decals are custom made in your size and color we cannot offer returns. Vinyl decals can become damaged during installation if handled improperly. If you did not get instructions, are having trouble installing a decal, or are unsure of your ability to install one, (normally larger ones require experience or an extra hand) please stop installation and contact us. Any local sign professional can install these with ease - we cannot be responsible if the decal is damaged during installation.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1467758642,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Thank you for contacting us.
