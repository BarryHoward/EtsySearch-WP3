Make sure your pup is representing the best. \n\n\u2022 Make sure you get the right size for you dog.\nAll collars are adjustable with at least a three inch variation\nWe suggest measuring your dog\u2019s neck in inches prior to purchasing\nAll collars are available in buckle\/webbing width of \u00be\u201d, 1\u201d, or 1-\u00bd\u201c\nThe suggested sizing range is as follows:\n\u00be\u201d Buckle \u2013 X-Small (7-10 inches) or Small (8-12inches)\n1\u201d Buckle \u2013 Small (7-10 inches), Medium (11-17 inches) or Large (17-26 inches)\n1-\u00bd\u201c Buckle \u2013 Medium (11-17 inches) or Large (17-26)\nIf you would like a different size\/buckle combination other than what is listed, or you require a different size all together, please send me a message.\n\n\u2022 My collars are made by sewing brightly colored and patterned cotton fabric over a heavy polypropylene webbing core rather than using a stabilizer. The benefits of heavy polypropylene webbing is that it is resistant to water, mold, mildew, stretching and UV-Rays. I want your dog\u2019s collar to be strong, durable and last as long as possible.\n\n\u2022 Collars are made with metal buckles and hardware, not only for the look, but for the durability and strength.\n\n\u2022 Each collar is made to order, so there may be slight variations in stitching, color, and pattern placement, depending on the cut of the fabric. Additionally, because each collar is made to order, please allow 7-10 business days prior to shipping.\n\n\u2022 Collars are hand washable and can be hung to dry without losing their shape.\n\n\u2022 After time collars can become subject to everyday wear-and-tear; so please replace them as necessary for the safety of your pet.\n\n\u2022 If you have any questions in regards to your order, or have a request for a custom order, please send me a message. Additionally, I am always looking for new fabric suggestions.\n\n\u2022 We are new here at Collars by Kylie, so please keep checking back for new fabric options, as well as the addition of accessories and leashes!","creation_tsz":1476632456,"ending_tsz":1487263256,"original_creation_tsz":1474299753,"last_modified_tsz":1476632456,"price":"22.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":12,"tags":["Black and Gold ","Football","NFL","Pittsburgh Steelers","Pittsburgh","Steelers","Collar","Fashion","Dog Fashion","Dog Collar"],"category_path":["Pets"],"category_path_ids":[68887434],"materials":["Polypropylene Core","Cotton Fabric","Metal Hardware","Heavy Welded DRing","Aluminum Buckle"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1474299753,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/479849249\/pittsburgh-steelers-adjustable-dog?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":12,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1384,"taxonomy_path":["Pet Supplies","Pet Collars & Leashes","Pet Collars & Jewelry"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1046184964,"hex_code":"947A74","red":148,"green":122,"blue":116,"hue":11,"saturation":21,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1474299862,"listing_id":479849249,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/12673348\/il_75x75.1046184964_9z11.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/12673348\/il_170x135.1046184964_9z11.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/12673348\/il_570xN.1046184964_9z11.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/12673348\/il_fullxfull.1046184964_9z11.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":1046184970,"hex_code":"927266","red":146,"green":114,"blue":102,"hue":16,"saturation":30,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1474299862,"listing_id":479849249,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12673348\/il_75x75.1046184970_9l77.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12673348\/il_170x135.1046184970_9l77.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12673348\/il_570xN.1046184970_9l77.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12673348\/il_fullxfull.1046184970_9l77.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":1092744035,"hex_code":"8D796C","red":141,"green":121,"blue":108,"hue":24,"saturation":23,"brightness":55,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1474299862,"listing_id":479849249,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/118\/0\/12673348\/il_75x75.1092744035_kk2f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/118\/0\/12673348\/il_170x135.1092744035_kk2f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/118\/0\/12673348\/il_570xN.1092744035_kk2f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/118\/0\/12673348\/il_fullxfull.1092744035_kk2f.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":12673348,"shop_name":"CollarsByKylie","user_id":83462225,"creation_tsz":1458774749,"title":"Handmade Adjustable Dog Collars","announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"Kylie is going on vacation!

This means if you purchase more multiple cuts, you will likely be overcharged for shipping. We will combine your order so you are able to receive the most cost effective shipping price. Any orders with overcharges over the will be partially refunded once the order is shipped. These refunds are based on the prices above. Please use this info to see approximate charges for First Class Mail and Priority Mail shipping.\r\n\r\nWe work very hard to keep the Etsy auto-charge shipping rates close to accurate. In some circumstances, an overage will still occur on the auto-charge.

Priority mail orders have $50 of insurance automatically. But any insurance above that or insurance for first class is the responsibility of the customer. We have absolutely zero control over the procedures of the post office and the conduct of their employees. Thus, we are not liable for their mistakes and their mistakes are not a reflection of our company. \r\n\r\nPackages with a value over $200 will have signature confirmation and must be signed for upon arrival.

Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you choose.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES FEES\nBuyers are responsible for any customs or duties fees that may apply. Sellers aren't responsible for delays due to customs","policy_refunds":"I GLADLY ACCEPT CANCELLATIONS\nRequest a cancellation within: 24 hours of purchase\n\nI DON'T ACCEPT RETURNS OR EXCHANGES\nBut please contact me if you have any problems with your order.","policy_additional":"I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nARE THERE ANY ACTIVE COUPON CODES?\nAll promos and active codes are posted on Instagram or Facebook. If you do not see anything recently posted, then there is no active promotion or code at the time!\n\nIS THERE TRACKING FOR MY ORDER? WHEN WILL MY ORDER ARRIVE?\nIn order to keep shipping costs low, all orders are sent via regular mail so there is no tracking. If you wish to add tracking, please message me! Otherwise, shipping estimates are as stated in the Shipping Section!\n\nPlease note that these are Canada Post&#39;s additional costs for registered mail:\n\n- registered mail to Canada: additional $9.00 \n- registered and expedited (mandatory) mail to USA: additional $26.15\n- registered mail to International: additional $17.50\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF MY ORDER HAS NOT ARRIVED IN THE ESTIMATED TIMEFRAME?\nIf your order has not arrived within the estimated delivery time, please message me here on Etsy and I will try my best to figure something out with you!\n\nIf your order is actually confirmed to be lost after waiting one more week on top of the estimated delivery times, any possible reshipment fees must be paid by you.\n\nIS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE ORDERS TO SAVE ON SHIPPING?\nIf your first order has not yet been marked as shipped and you place another order within 24 hours, feel free to message me to to request this. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill your request because your order might have already been filled, packaged, and stamped even if it is not shipped. If it has been over 24 hours, we will be unable to combine shipping because your order will most likely already be sealed, packaged, and stamped. **In addition, this may not apply during sales or promotions so please read the details for each promotion carefully!**\n\nWHAT SIZE ARE THE STICKERS? HOW MANY ARE ON ONE SHEET?\nThe listing photos for each listing displays the size of the stickers on a full Erin Condren box (1.5x1.9 inch). That will give you an estimate for how large the stickers are. The second listing photo also shows full sheet of stickers so you can see how many stickers are included on each sheet. The description for each listing also describes the size of the sticker sheet.\n\nCAN I REQUEST A CUSTOM ORDER FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN&#39;T IN THE SHOP?\nYes, we accept custom requests onto a waitlist. Depending on how many people are on the waitlist, wait times can range from 2 weeks up to one month. Please contact me if you are interested in having a custom sticker created and I will let you know if I am currently able to accept personalized requests or not!

Each large bath fizz is hand made using the finest ingredients to include Vitamin E for soft skin, Epsom Salt for relaxing, and a buildable toy inside for play time! These are SLS free! They won&#39;t even know that the toy is inside unless you tell them first.  Drop the bomb in the tub and watch it fizz away in the water to reveal three pieces for a buildable Little Football Player and a lingering fragrance in the tub. One buildable toy per bath bomb.  Bath Bomb will be in coordinating colors of the team.  Football Player Toys are 2.5 inches high and 2 inches wide.  Makes a great gift, balloon tie, stocking stuffer, party favor, secret Santa, basket filler or hidden in the grass at Easter time. Bath Bomb is almost 8 oz. total, 4 inches in diameter.  \n\nWant to customize your NFL Football Player Bath Candy?  Choose your fragrance, ribbon, and even a custom  tag by selecting the CUSTOM Ribbon Tag option.  This would be similar to the last photo in the listing with ribbon and tag but yours will coordinate with your team.  If you do not select the CUSTOM option with ribbon and tag, your bath bomb will come in clear wrap with label on the back.  Just convo us with details on how we can make your party special!  We will create a custom order just for you. Ribbon type will vary.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is NOT a licensed NFL New Orleans Saints Football bath bomb.

This is now a problem with the post office, and you will need to file a claim with your local USPS office to receive your refund. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to help save the environment we at Bon Bon Bath House take box donations from local buyers and use these to ship products.  The recycled boxes mean less waste for us and the environment and less cost for you!","policy_refunds":"We will be happy to issue a refund!  If there is a problem with your product, just return the product to us and we will return your purchase price and shipping paid for the item when purchased.  Please note that we use natural ingredients in our soap and bath products.  A different shade of your requested color does not constitute and acceptable problem with your order.  Bath candies are made with natural ingredients and sometimes have cracks on the surface due to the amount of humidity in the air when made and the salt in the product.  This does not mean your product is damaged and in no way affects the performance of your bath bomb.  This also does not constitute a problem with your order.  Melted Soaps, Lotions and Butters that are delivered to your address and left to remain in the heat for an extended period of time does not constitute a problem with your order as it was not in this condition when shipped.","policy_additional":"We LOVE TO SAVE you on shipping!

Returned items must be in the original condition in which shipped. Shipping fees for exchanged or returned items will not be refunded. Buyers must contact me immediately if an item arrives damaged.

All content\/photos \u00a9 Designs by Laurel Leigh.\n\nAll of my necklaces are original one-of-a-kind designs. Snag one quickly if you see one you love. I don&#39;t generally make duplicates, unless upon special request and only as supplies are available. \n\nIMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT MY ORNAMENTS:\n\nMost of my ornaments are made to order, since I will not generally be able to keep a running inventory of finished products outside of the holiday season. Inventory may be lower on ornaments, depending on the time of year. As such, I request that you please contact me prior to making custom orders to ensure availability of stock. \n\nPrices may be slightly higher on some custom ornament orders due to the significant amount of time spent on preparing samples, mock-ups and adjustments. Most of my ornaments are hand drawn in ink or oil paint. Hand painted versions will  usually have higher prices due to the significant differences in labor time (application of multiple paint layers) and materials. \n\nAll of my ornaments are hand painted\/drawn original designs and they are tiny pieces of art. I do not use stencils and generally do not make the same design twice, unless requested by my customers and even then, each one will vary slightly. Ornaments are glass, making them very fragile. Ornaments should be handled carefully; paint or ink can scratch or smear if exposed to rough handling or surfaces. Keep ornaments away from lotions, hand sanitizers or other liquids. \n\nI take pride in my work and make every attempt to make my work neat with clean lines, but please keep in mind that there may be minor imperfections in certain areas; working on small, round, glass objects is very difficult when creating art by hand. If you look at vintage chinoiserie porcelain pieces, the craftsmanship can be quite sloppy, but sometimes that makes it fabulous. \n\nI use a variety of glass ornament manufacturers. Caps styles may vary and from time to time, the glass may have very minor flaws. I try to use ornaments with zero to minimal flaws. Most imperfections will generally not be noticeable, especially once hung on a tree.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1469211182,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello there-\n\nI will be on vacation from 7\/22-7\/31.
